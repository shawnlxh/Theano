# Theano
* I use Theano to construct convolutional neural network(CNN). 
* The project is to predict the Click Through Rate of advertisements in searching web pages.
* I apply CNN to solve the problem, and the cardinal jobs are tranfer the data to the right form and design the structure of the model.
* Here I use an one-dimensional CNN, but the result is not impressive. So I view this project as the learning of the use of Theano, a 
typical deep learning framework.
